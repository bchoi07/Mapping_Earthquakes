# Mapping Earthquakes

The purpose of this project was to create an interactive map with earthquake data from around the world. Using GeoJSON data and Javascript along with Leaflet, the map was created so that overlays and layers containing data on earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes can be easily changed.
